# WEB-TECHNOLOGIES-LAB-ASSIGNMENT-2

For this asignment, it has been developed a basic view of the web page of the project. 

//IMPORTANT//

1) The evaluation for this asignment, is a basic demonstration of few models of the complete project (is been this way, because this assignment don't require javascript). For this demonstartion, the models that are used are: User, Profile, Post, Dumpster, Blacklist, Registration and Session. 

The models like: Admin , comments, votes, etc. Are not used by the motive already explained. 

2) In the creation of a new User, if this one it is saved correctly, the page will be redirect to the layout that creates a new Profile. Here it is asked to put an User, for this it is required the recently created User ID. It is very probably that the value for this be 1. If not, it can be reviwed in the Rails console (we are actually working to fix this issue).
